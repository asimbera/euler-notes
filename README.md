# Project Euler Notes

### Languages Implemented: `JavaScript`

These repo contains my notes on the problems of Project Euler.
I've heavily used **bruteforce** techniques in the solutions.
The solutions are mostly undocumented. I'm adding descriptions to the code very slowly.
There are references in each document which are crucial to solve that problem.

### Translations:
1. [Bengali](questions_bn.md)

### Solutions:
[x] [1. Multiples of 3 and 5](Problem%20001/README.md)
[x] [2. Even Fibonacci numbers](Problem%20002/README.md)
[x] [3. Largest prime factor](Problem%20003/index.js) (Undocumented)
[x] [4. Largest palindrome product](Problem%20004/index.js) (Undocumented)

##### Note from Project Euler  
> The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.

So, if you stumble upon this repo just don't copy paste the whole code. And please read the rule and recommendations on the site.
