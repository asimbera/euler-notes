### Project Euler Notes

---

These are my notes on the problems of Project Euler.
I've heavily used **bruteforce** techniques in the solutions and there are pure algorithms very rarely.
The solutions are mostly undocumented. I'm adding descriptions to the code very slowly.
There are references in each document which are crucial to solve that problem.

As Project Euler website states that they don't restrict publishing solutions to problems upto 100 outside their forum. So, if you stumble on this repo just don't copy paste the whole code. And please read the rule and recommendation on their website.
